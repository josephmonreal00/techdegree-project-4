OOP Game Show App

As for the images I added two different images that represent when player selects the wrong key.
Inside the images directory you will find x.png and skull.png. Skull.png will represent the lives left while x.png will replace the skull whenever the user selects the wrong keys. 

Keyboard background color has been changed along with the background color of a key when a user selects a matching or unmatching key. 

Along with the font-family I have imported a different font from google fonts and have also change the default colors of the title heading, start game background, and end game background. 

I have also added a slight 2px shadow on the keys and changed the color of the background for the phrase and increased the pixel size for --font-size-large: 90px;
